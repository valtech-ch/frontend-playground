# Frontend Playground

Playground intended for experimental stacks developed by the Frontend Practice Area.

## Packages

The repository architecture is a monorepo setup with lerna and yarn workspaces. Therefore, independent projects can be stored in the `packages` folder.

Those are the existing packages:
